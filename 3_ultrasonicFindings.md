## Our findings

# 1
Below 10cm, it starts to get less reliable, and below 5cm, values stop decreasing and we get incorrect measurements.
After 220cm, we get incorrect measurements.

# 2
We tested with a radius of 50cm, with 90° being perpendicular to the wall and 0° being parallel to the wall.
At 90° = 50cm
At 85° = 50cm
At 80° = 49cm
At 70° = 48cm
At 67.5° = 46cm
At 45° = 43cm
At 22.5° = 29cm
Additionally, we also tested with a radius of 90cm to have more datapoints by controlling our radius variable:
At 90° = 100cm
At 85° = 100cm
At 80° = 98cm
At 70° = 95cm
The maximum angular deviation from perpendicular to the wall at which it will still give sensible readings is 85°. There is also some human error.
